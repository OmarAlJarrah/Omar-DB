# ACID Criteria
The ACID criteria is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably. The acronym ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. This report will discuss each of these properties and how they are used to ensure the reliability of database transactions.

## Atomicity
Atomicity is the property that ensures that a database transaction is treated as a single, indivisible operation. This means that if a transaction is interrupted, either due to a failure or a system error, the entire transaction will be rolled back and the database will be returned to its previous state. This ensures that the database remains in a consistent state and that no partial updates are applied.

## Consistency
Consistency is the property that ensures that a database transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. This means that a transaction must obey all integrity constraints and business rules defined for the database. This ensures that the data in the database is accurate, complete, and consistent with the business rules of the application.

## Isolation
Isolation is the property that ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. This means that each transaction is executed as if it were the only transaction in the system. This ensures that the data in the database is correct and consistent, even in the presence of concurrent transactions.

## Durability
Durability is the property that ensures that once a transaction is committed, its effects will survive any subsequent failures. This means that the data in the database is written to non-volatile storage, such as disk, and that it will persist even if the system crashes or there is a power outage. This ensures that the data in the database is safe and can be recovered in the event of a failure.

## ACID in Action
ACID guarantees the reliability of transactions in a database. For example, consider a bank transfer transaction which transfers money from one account to another. The ACID properties ensure that the transaction is atomic, so that the transfer is either completed or not completed, with no intermediate states. The consistency property ensures that the transfer is valid and that the account balances are updated correctly. The isolation property ensures that other transactions do not interfere with the transfer. The durability property ensures that the transfer is recorded in the database and that it will survive any subsequent failures.

## Conclusion
The ACID criteria is a set of properties that are essential for ensuring the reliability of database transactions. They ensure that database transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated and durable. By adhering to these properties, databases can provide a consistent, accurate and reliable data storage service. Understanding these properties and how they interact is crucial for building robust and fault-tolerant databases.
