# SaaS (Software as a Service)
In order to provide services to users in a cloud environment, Spring Boot Framework is used to expose web services through endpoints, which gives users the ability to consume the service up to their needs.

## Overview
### What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is a Java-based framework that is used to create stand-alone, production-grade applications. It is built on top of the Spring Framework, and it uses convention over configuration to simplify the development process. 

Spring Boot provides a set of starter POMs (dependency descriptors) that can be included in a project's build file to automatically configure Spring and related libraries for the application. 

It also provides an embedded server, which eliminates the need to deploy the application to an external server. This makes it easy to build and run applications from a single command, and it also makes it easy to create self-contained executable JARs for deployment. 

Spring Boot is designed to get developers up and running as quickly as possible, with minimal upfront configuration required.

### Why Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is a popular choice for building enterprise-level applications due to many reasons such as (but not limited to):
1) **Simplicity**: Spring Boot simplifies the development process by using convention over configuration. It provides a set of starter POMs (dependency descriptors) that automatically configure Spring and related libraries for the application, reducing the amount of boilerplate code that needs to be written.

2) **Flexibility**: Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring Framework, which provides a wide range of features and modules for building enterprise applications. This allows developers to easily integrate various technologies and frameworks into their applications.

3) **Scalability**: Spring Boot allows developers to create stand-alone, production-grade applications that can be easily deployed to different environments. It also provides an embedded server, which makes it easy to build and run applications, and allows them to be easily scaled as needed.

4) **Production-ready**: Spring Boot comes with a wide range of features that are essential for production-ready applications, such as metrics and health checks, security, and embedded servers. This helps companies get their applications up and running quickly and with minimal effort.

5) **Popularity**: Spring Boot is a popular framework and has a large community. This means that developers are more likely to be familiar with it, and that there is a wealth of resources, tutorials, and examples available online.

## Implementation
Spring Boot provides web endpoints for REST APIs by using the Spring Framework's REST module. This allows developers to easily create RESTful web services that follow best practices.

1) **Controllers**: Spring Boot provides support for creating REST controllers, which are classes that handle HTTP requests and return responses. Developers can use annotations such as @RestController and @RequestMapping to define the endpoint's URL, the HTTP method that it handles, and the parameters that it takes.

2) **Path variables and Request Parameters**: Spring Boot provides support for handling path variables and request parameters in the endpoint's URL using annotations such as @PathVariable and @RequestParam.

3) **Request and Response Body**: Spring Boot also provides support for handling request and response body using annotations such as @RequestBody and @ResponseBody.

4) **HTTP Status codes**: Spring Boot automatically handles the HTTP status codes and sends back the appropriate status codes based on the request.

5) **HATEOAS**: Spring Boot provides support for HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) which allows to include links to related resources in the response, making it easier to navigate and discover the API.

6) **JSON and XML support**: Spring Boot automatically handle the JSON and XML data for request and response, it's not necessary to add any extra libraries for that.

### Write Endpoint Sample
```java
@RequestMapping("/write")
public class WriteApi {
  @Autowired
  private ConcurrentWriter writer;

  @PostMapping("/{collection}/{id}")
  public ResponseEntity<String> write(@PathVariable("collection") String collectionName,
                                      @PathVariable("id") String id,
                                      @RequestBody JSONObject object) {

    try {
      writer.write(Id.fromString(id),object, collectionName);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      return new ResponseEntity<>(e.getMessage(), HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }
    return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.ACCEPTED);
  }
}
```

### Users Management Endpoint Sample
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UsersManagementApi {
  @Autowired
  UserManagementService service;

  private final Gson gson = new Gson();

  @PostMapping("/register")
  public ResponseEntity<String> registerUser(@RequestParam("role") String role, @RequestParam("name") String name) {
    ResponseEntity<String> response;
    try {
      User user = new User.UserBuilder()
          .name(name)
          .role(Role.valueOf(role))
          .username(UUID.randomUUID().toString())
          .password(UUID.randomUUID().toString())
          .build();

      service.addUser(user);
      response = new ResponseEntity<>(gson.toJson(user), HttpStatus.OK);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      response = new ResponseEntity<>(e.getMessage(), HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }
    return response;
  }

  @PostMapping("/delete")
  public ResponseEntity<String> deleteUser(@RequestParam("username") String username) {
    try {
      service.deleteUser(username);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      return new ResponseEntity<>(e.getMessage(), HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }
    return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.ACCEPTED);
  }
}
```
