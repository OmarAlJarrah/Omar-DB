# Conclusion
I have attempted to create a database that is optimized for read operations and eventual consistency, and attempted to give the read and write operations the capabilities of GraphQL on a level that is not known among popular document-based databases like `MongoDB`.

There has been some limitations, and I had to come up with new ideas and algorithms frequently, research a lot of topics and learn new concepts.

## Thank You Professors
I would like to thank all the professors who have helped me get to where I stand today. Also, I would like to thank Dr.Ameera Jaradat for her continues help and support on all levels, without her, I would never have achieved half of what I have today.

Thank you for reading till the end...
